			<h2>I figured I would use this website as a place to promote my YouTube videos. I've been doing it as a hobby for a while, and I think they turned out to be pretty good.</h2>
			<h1>Here's my best ones:</h1>
			<h2>Video 1: Playing Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory's Versus in 2021</h2>
			
			<div id="videos">
			<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6mKZkXv4YlY" ></iframe>
			</div>
			<p>Me and some friends play the versus mode for Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, which had its servers shut down in 2016. How are we still able to play? It's a really complicated process, so I don't want to go into it.</p>
			<h2>Video 2: Playing Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory's Versus in 2021: Aquarius Antics and Missile Strike Madness</h2>
			<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YMbMj5OpM6Q"></iframe>

			<h2>Video 3: Guitar Hero Review</h2>
			<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JPq-OE8mh90"></iframe>
			<p>The first video I made that I was really proud of. It's up to you if it still holds up.</p>
			<h2>Video 4: Halo Custom Games</h2>
			<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ukTNbIr1P_Q"></iframe>
			
			<p>Me and some friends play fan-made game modes on Halo: Master Chief Collection.</p>
